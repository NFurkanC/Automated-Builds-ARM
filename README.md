# GitHub Actions Build for Milk V Duo 

This repository is for compiling Milk V Duo S code on GitHub Actions. Just upload the code to src folder and push. It automatically compiles the code for Milk V Duo S and you can download it.


## I will add:
  <li> Configuration selection for milkv duo targets </li>
  <li>ARM and RISC-V selection</li>
  <li>Automatic selection between CMake/Make build systems</li>
  <li>Converting this repo to a template</li>
  <li>Better caching for other types of configurations</li>
